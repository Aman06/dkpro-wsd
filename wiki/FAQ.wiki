== About DKPro WSD ==

=== What is DKPro WSD? ===

DKPro WSD is a general-purpose framework for word sense disambiguation (WSD) which is both modular and extensible.  DKPro WSD was designed primarily to support the needs of WSD researchers, who will appreciate the convenience and flexibility it affords in tuning and comparing algorithms and data sets.  However, as a general-purpose toolkit it could also be used to implement a WSD module for a real-world natural language processing application.  Its support for interactive visualization of the disambiguation process also makes it a powerful tool for learning or teaching the principles of WSD.

By _modular_ we mean that the framework makes a logical separation between the _data sets_ (e.g., the corpora to be annotated, the answer keys, manually annotated training examples, etc.), the _sense inventories_ (i.e., the lexical-semantic resources enumerating the senses to which words in the corpora are assigned), and the _algorithms_ (i.e., code which actually performs the sense assignments and prerequisite linguistic annotations), and provides a standard interface for each of these component types.  Components which provide the same functionality can be freely swapped, so that one can easily run the same algorithm on different data sets (irrespective of which sense inventory they use), or test several different algorithms on the same data set.

By _extensible_ we mean that it is easy to adapt to work with new methods and resources.  The system is written in Java and is based on [https://uima.apache.org/ Apache UIMA], an industry-standard architecture for analysis of unstructured information.  Support for new corpus formats, sense inventories, and WSD algorithms can be added by implementing new UIMA components for them, or more conveniently by writing UIMA wrappers around existing code.

=== What licence is DKPro WSD released under? ===

The code in the [https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-wsd/ dkpro-wsd project] is licensed under the terms of the [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Apache Licence 2.0].  The code in the [https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-wsd-gpl/ dkpro-wsd-gpl project] is licensed under the terms of the [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html GNU General Public License, Version 3].

=== How do I get DKPro WSD? ===

The [https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-wsd/source/checkout source code for DKPro WSD] (and the [https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-wsd-gpl/source/checkout DKPro WSD GPL components) is available in Google Code's Subversion repository.

Maven users can obtain prepackage artifacts by adding the following repository section to your project:

{{{
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>ukp-oss-releases</id>
    <url>http://zoidberg.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifactory/public-releases</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
}}}

You can then add individual DKPro WSD artifacts to your POM.  For example:
{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd</groupId>
    <artifactId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.core</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

=== What is the relationship between DKPro WSD and DKPro Core? ===

[https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/ DKPro Core] is a collection of general-purpose software components for natural language processing (NLP) based on the [https://uima.apache.org/ Apache UIMA] framework. DKPro WSD is a separate product in the DKPro family which provides a unified framework and set of tools geared specifically towards word sense disambiguation.  Many of the modules in DKPro WSD make use of or extend DKPro Core components.

=== How can I cite DKPro WSD in a paper I'm writing? ===

To reference DKPro WSD please cite the following paper:

== Using DKPro WSD ==

=== What corpus readers should I use for the various Senseval and SemEval data sets? ===

The formats for the Senseval and SemEval data sets differ from task to task, and from year to year.  First, refer to our table of CorpusFormats to find out which format is used by the data set you are interested in.  Then, consult the table below to see which reader class works with that format:

|| *Format* || *Reader class* ||
|| Senseval-2 LS || `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.io.reader.Senseval2LSReader` ||
|| Senseval-2 AW || `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.io.reader.Senseval2AWReader` ||
|| Semeval-1 AW || `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.io.reader.Semeval1AWReader` ||
|| Semeval-2 AW || `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.io.reader.Semeval2AWReader` ||

All the above classes are in the module `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.senseval`.

=== What sense inventories should I use for the various Senseval and SemEval data sets? ===

The sense inventories for the Senseval and SemEval data sets differ from task to task, and from year to year.  Please refer to our table of CorpusFormats to find out which sense inventory is used by the data set you are interested in.  DKPro WSD supports many (but not all) of the sense inventories in this table.

For data sets which use WordNet, you can use various modules, depending on the underlying WordNet library you prefer to use.  There is `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.si.wordnet` (which wraps [http://extjwnl.sourceforge.net/ extJWNL]), `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.si.lsr` (which wraps [https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-lsr/ DKPro LSR]), and `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.si.uby` (which wraps [https://code.google.com/p/uby/ UBY]).  `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.si.wordnet` can also be used with EuroWordNet (EWN) sense inventories, provided they are in Princeton WordNet format.  (You can use [https://code.google.com/p/jmwnl/ JMWNL] to convert EWN sense inventories to Princeton WordNet format.)

=== Where can I get the !WordNet 1.7 pre-release used by the English Senseval-2 tasks? ===

You probably can't.  This version of WordNet was never officially published, but was made available only to the participants.  We contacted both the WordNet maintainers and the Senseval-2 organizers, and neither was able to locate a copy of this version.  A Senseval-2 participant sent us a copy he had archived, but its sense keys turned out to be incompatible with those of the Senseval-2 data sets.
